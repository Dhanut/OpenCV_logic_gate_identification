# OpenCV_logic_gate_identification
Generating Boolean expression using image processing

Deriving the logical model of hand-drawn logic circuit diagram.
The provided image of the hand-drawn circuit diagram will be analyzed. 
After extracting the features of the image, the recognition of the inputs, outputs, components and the connection among them. 
Based on the recognized elements, the Boolean expression of the given logic circuit diagram will be derived.
